# 🌊 Wave — Share Files Without Internet

**Wave** is a simple and fast Android app that lets you share files with nearby devices — no internet needed.  
It uses your phone’s built-in ability to create a **local-only Wi-Fi hotspot** and connects other devices through a QR code.  
Just open the app, scan, and share — it's that easy!

Wave is built with **Material 3**, giving it a clean, modern look that feels right at home on any Android device.

## 🧭 How to Use

1. Open **Wave** on both devices  
2. Each device creates a hotspot and waits for the other to scan  
3. On one device, tap **Scan QR** at the top right to scan the other device’s QR code  
4. After connecting:  
   - The **host** waits for the sender to start the transfer  
   - The **sender** selects files to send  
5. Tap **Send** at the top right to begin sharing  

That’s it — fast, easy, and completely offline.
